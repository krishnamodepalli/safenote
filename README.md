A simple python flask application which is a clone of the all-student beloved
[protectedtext](https://protectedtext.com).
Used basic html, css, js for the front-end
mainly `Flask` & `mysql` for the back-end working and the database management.

To crate a new page in the safenote, just go to a path like
`/<anything-you-want>`, and you get to ask for the password, and that's it.
